What is Liverum Books?

Liverum Books is a blockchain based eBook platform aiming to give back writers and readers alike a true Book publishing and reading experience. 
Writers or publishers will be able to create TRON BookTokens representing actual book copies.
Liverum users will be able to buy, lend, gift, re-sell their BookTokens whenever they want with several benefits to both authors and users (Details to be released later on when smart contracts are available)

Liverum platform will take care of verifying each user account to detect registered BookTokens so they can be shown in each user private Book shelf. All of this process will comply with the highest security measures.

Liverum's current approach fully relies on online account verification (TRON blockchain account) using a Chrome browser extention called TronLink or any Tronweb/Sunweb compatible dApp explorer, however future releases will include dedicated Android, iOS and physical blockchain enabled eReaders (similar to a kindle device) to enable Offline book access as well.

Is Liverum secure for writers/publishers and readers? How?

Liverum dApp will use private key encrypted BTFS files to make sure unwanted actors take control of plain eBooks released by authors. Ebook decrypt process will take place internally inside the software making sure no plain text copies are stored in user devices to increase confidence from authors and fight against piracy. Users will own their own book copies as long as they have the corresponding BookToken, they will be able to decrypt its content using their TRON account private key, this will lead to Offline visualization in a similar fashion used in Spotify or Netflix. 

Why Liverum Books?

eBook piracy was and is currently a major digital content framework that hasn't been explored enough by content creators, publishers and ebook companies alike. Based on historical records, music, movies, books and basically any other digital product nowadays are still hard to produce but easily reproduced and distributed, giving any person the possibility to take advantage and get content creators hard working material at zero cost. 

What are eBook piracy side effects ?
Writers are less encouraged to create digital versions of their books 
Writers need to go for DRM versions of their books to prevent piracy.
DRM fights piracy by reducing book buyers options ( they cannot lend, gift or re-sell their books at will)
DRM, after all security improvements is still hack-able.
Liverum is approaching digital content ownership from a  different perspective, people deserve to own their own content without restrictions and authors deserve to receive remuneration for their hard work products and Blockchain + BTFS + Cryptography can provide that.


Why is Liverum Books different to any other eBook platform?

Book authors have the control on Book supply as well as "new release price".
Book authors can trace where their books are going after released (due to TRON public blockchain capabilities)
Book owners retain some rights as lending, gifting even re-selling as experienced with their physical books.
BookTokens are tangible, thus providing a better experience rather than just having an infinite supply of pdf or ePub copies.


How does Liverum benefit TRON ecosystem?


Liverum lives mainly on the sunnetwork, meaning constant deposits and withdrawals from mainchain will automatically benefit TRON as fees are charged to users or the platform itself.
Besides fees Liverum will bring non crypto users to TRON without  even knowing about it.

Bringing a true reading experience powered by TRON blockchain is our our purpose, book fans will surely love Liverum.
To have a plain and simple UI to ease user adoption without the crypto wallet / exchanges ramp-up pain is another goal for us.

At the end of the day TRX holders and the network as a whole will benefit from Liverum transactions as the platform grows by creating currency deflation.


How does Liverum Books benefit from blockchain technology?

- Liverum will fight back piracy with its unique BookTokens approach. Book ownership is linked to each individual encrypted private key/wallet making it harder for bad actors to copy and paste eBooks at their will.
- Public Blockchains like TRON brings transparency to the platform users ( writers and readers) meaning everyone is able to see book supply, transactions and track book sells as needed
- Blockchain brings trustless transactions to reality and TRON smartcontracts will help the  Liverum platform to provide fair money transactions between writers, publishers and readers
- Using BTFS as a book storage solution will help to reduce data storage costs compared to taditional data server plans.
- BTFS private key encryption and files sharding is key for Liverum as this will greatly decrease the possibility of ebook files being hacked and decrypted by any kind of bad actors.


Why does Liverum deserve the $5k prize?

We are proposing an innovative solution to solve digital assets ownership and we have big plans to bring this to reality. You can see this in our roadmap.
We are not making an ICO or any fundrising campaign until our physical e-reader comes. Our funds will depend on prizes like the Sunnetwork challenge for our hard work, passion and dedication to bring new and innovative use cases for TRON as well as book selling when Liverum publishing house BookTokens are live in the platform.

TRON deserves and needs more non gaming-casino like dApps, and Liverum plans to bring just that into the ecosystem.


How are we investing the prize? 

First of all we need secure smart contracts to be developed for the TRC -20 BookTokens and the Liverum market platform. I plan to hire top-notch TRON blockchain developers for this purpose so the platform guarantees writers, publishers and book owners the security they deserve as well as improving the current UI.
If some remains I plan to use the rest to buy trx and freeze for energy and bandwidth to operate the dApp.
